# Fannish Discord Server List

## About this list

This is intended to be a quick way to look up and join fannish or fan-friendly discord servers. Any server that has been known to have age requirements, modding idiosyncracies or other caveats will have that referred to in their notes.

Fandoms are a mix of what I know is currently hot and what people request to be added. If your fandom isn't on the list, open an issue and I'll do what I can to hunt down a server and an invite link or two. 

Servers are pretty much going to be what I can find via searches, [Disboard](https://disboard.org "Disboard.org"), and tips from internet strangers. 

Obviously, which servers and fandoms get added is at my discretion. While I will try my best to add (or remove!) servers when asked via an issue, a Discord DM or a Dreamwidth PM, I will obviously make mistakes. Or the invite link I have up will turn up as expired, or the server might turn out to be private, or for the wrong fandom, or just dead. If that happens, please let me know what went wrong so I can try to fix the issue.
