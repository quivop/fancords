# Fannish Discord Server List

## intro

This is intended to be a quick way to look up and join fannish or fan-friendly discord servers. Any server that has been known to have age requirements, modding idiosyncracies or other caveats will have that referred to in their notes.

Fandoms are a mix of what I know is currently hot and what people request to be added. If your fandom isn't on the list, open an issue and I'll do what I can to hunt down a server and an invite link. 

Servers are pretty much going to be what I can find via searches, [Disboard](https://disboard.org "Disboard.org"), and tips from internet strangers.
